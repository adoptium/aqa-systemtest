/**
 * SolverTest
 * ================
 * 
 * The game this code was initially designed to solve consists of 36 square cards, which each have 4 symbols on them.
 * (Symbols are denoted by letters below).
 * The cards must be arranged in a 6x6 grid such the symbols on the edges of adjacent cards match up.
 * 
 * This test has historically caused the JIT to crash or give incorrect results from time to time
